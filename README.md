Analytics, according to the data entered by all employees, look in another application - MeatKGB2.

Registration data (enterprise ID, username/password) are issued to the employee by the administrator who configures them using another the application MeatKGB2.

Access to application tools can be either from an individual device for each employee or workshop, or from a single device to the entire enterprise. In the first case, the enterprise ID and username/password will need to be entered once, in the case of group access, each employee will need to enter registration data each time before entering the data per shift.

If you are a small enterprise with geographically dispersed production and trading sites, for example, a network of 2-3 small catering enterprises, with one production workshop, this is not a complex and free application that will benefit you.
